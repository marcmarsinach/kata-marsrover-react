### Satatement
Youâ€™re part of the team that explores Mars by sending remotely controlled vehicles to the surface of the planet. Develop an API that translates the commands sent from earth to instructions that are understood by the rover.

### Requirements
- You are given the initial starting point (0,0,N) of a rover.
- 0,0 are X,Y co-ordinates on a grid of (10,10).
- N is the direction it is facing (i.e. N,S,E,W).
- L and R allow the rover to rotate left and right.
- M allows the rover to move one point in the current direction.
- The rover receives a char array of commands e.g. RMMLM and returns the finishing point after the moves e.g. 2,1,N
- The rover wraps around if it reaches the end of the grid.
- The grid may have obstacles. If a given sequence of commands encounters an obstacle, the rover moves up to the last possible point and reports the obstacle e.g. O,2,2,N
